## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Javascript with syntax for types
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [xml2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js#node-xml2js) - XML to Javascript object converter





### My decisions and assumptions

- I decided to create a single page application
- I tried to learn the data from Finansportalen. But didn't understand fully. So I decided to create a model which shows information irrespective of whether the information is important or not.
- I tried to make the components reusable and accessible.


### Continued development
If I get more time

- I would make the website responsive.
- I would try to show more information from the data by adding a modal or changing the height of the container which carries the information.
- I would learn the data and gather more information and will add a feature that enables the user to fill in the current bank account details and gets an insight into how much money can be saved by switching to a better account.
- I would try to add a chatbot.
